# Usage

Before starting, be aware this bundle only integrates the [Ivory Google Map](https://github.com/egeloen/ivory-google-map) 
library into your Symfony project. So, start reading it's documentation before reading this one.

Once you're familiar with the library, you can learn more about the following integrations:

 - [Map](/Resources/doc/map.md)
 - [Static Map](/Resources/doc/static_map.md)
 - [Place Autocomplete](/Resources/doc/place_autocomplete.md)
 - [Services](/Resources/doc/service/index.md)
     - [Direction](/Resources/doc/service/direction.md)
     - [Distance Matrix](/Resources/doc/service/distance_matrix.md)
     - [Elevation](/Resources/doc/service/elevation.md)
     - [Geocoder](/Resources/doc/service/geocoder.md)
     - [Time Zone](/Resources/doc/service/time_zone.md)
